        Hello, my name is Michael, and this is my website/portfolio. I am a
        student, creating and occasionally finishing computer projects in my
        free time.
      </p>
      <h2>What you can find here</h2>
      <p>
        Here you can find various projects that I put on display, as well as
        digital and physical things that I find interesting. Occasionally I may
        keep thoughts or notes I want to share as well.
